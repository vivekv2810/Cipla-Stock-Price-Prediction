# Cipla-Stock-Price-Prediction
This project predicts Cipla's stock price using several machine learning models: LSTM, SVM, SVR, KNN, and K-Means Clustering. The project includes exploratory data analysis (EDA), data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation. Each model predicts the stock price, and results are compared with actual data using various performance metrics.
